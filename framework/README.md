# **Cloak** - A Hybrid Development Framework for HarmonyOS

**Cloak** is a hybrid development framework designed specifically for **HarmonyOS**, similar to [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) and [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/), but **simpler** and **more lightweight**.

## Core Features

- **Quick Packaging**: Rapidly package **H5 applications** into **HarmonyOS applications**.
- **Native Capability Access**: Supports calling native capabilities through a **plugin mechanism**.
- **Webview Support**: Provides robust **webview** support to ensure smooth performance of H5 applications on HarmonyOS.
- **Plugin Development**: Developers can easily create **plugins** to extend native capabilities.
